### FAQ

**Q**: This isn't the app you teased last year! What gives?
**A**: That app did work, but it worked poorly and was a blatant violation of copyright – it recreated the entire DOM structure of iChat, and redistributed all of it's assets. This is built with a completely structure and is free of Apple dependencies. All assets are sourced from the host machine.
